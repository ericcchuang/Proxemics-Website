<p><h3>Report</h3></p>
<p>Below is a web copy of our more detailed report on the findings. A document version can be found <a href="#">here.</a></p>
<hr>
 <p><h4>Abstract</h4></p>
<p>The goal of this study is to discover how people put up posters in a situation with limited available space. To accomplish this, we gave participants posters of various content to put on a board in two different scenarios to see how they use up the space available to them. Observing their behavior let us explore what different spaces, poster content, and other properties people prioritized when forced to work with a finite area.</p>  

<p><h4>Rationale</h4></p>
<p>At a school like NJIT where thousands of students are crammed into a space of only a few city blocks, understanding how the student body takes up space with advertising will only be vital as the years go on. Without any development towards new infrastructure, maximizing current available space and understanding how current students perceive taking up space will help any event or program enhance their current engagement with the university student body.</p>

<p><h4>Participants and Participant Recruitment</h4></p>
<p>We recruited participants by asking our friends to ensure that we had a variety of viewpoints represented. We had four participants in this study, all sophomores of varying involvement on campus. As established in their opening interviews, they ranged from very active, to active in specific clubs they are dedicated to, to not active at all. This was to see if those who were familiar with the content on the posters would bias themselves in any way.</p>

<p><h4>Data Collection</h4></p>
<p>We start the participant with a short starting interview, asking about their activity on campus and how often they use bulletin boards or other communal spaces on campus. After this, the board is presented.</p>
<p>The board had four posters already placed on it, two towards the corners and two near the center. Intentionally, the board is too small to fit all the posters, comfortably fitting only about 15. The remaining posters were divided into two stacks based on the order they would be handed to the participant: a larger stack of 14 for the first scenario, and a smaller stack of 5 for the second scenario, all of various contents. These numbers were chosen intentionally, so that the board was barely overfilled at the end of the first scenario.</p>
<p>After the opening interview, the participant is handed the stack of 14 posters and told to arrange the posters any way they see fit on the board. They can move any poster of those 14 around, but cannot move any pre-placed posters. Participants were told that they can ask questions and to vocalize their thought process, and that they had around 10 minutes to complete the task. No further instruction was given other than 5 minute and 1 minute warnings, unless the participant asked a question.</p>
<p>After placing the first 14 posters, the participant is presented with 5 more posters, and told to place them as well. However, there is the caveat that posters from the previous scenario are now treated as immovable. The same instructions were given, with a 5 minute time limit.</p>
<p>Finally, we interviewed the participant with the closing interview. They were asked questions on what posters they covered up, what their thought process was, what content they valued on a poster, and how they prioritized the use of space. We also asked them more specific questions on the behaviors observed as they placed the posters. </p>

<p><h4>Data Analysis Methods</h4></p>
<p><i>Coding Cycle #1: In-Vivo Coding</i></p>
<p>To start effectively synthesizing the code for such an interesting collection of data, we utilized the in-vivo coding process with the transcripts of the start and ending interviews conducted for each participant. By utilizing the exact text to develop code, we believed it would create a better, more objective end result without the filter of generalization from the lens of either of us. We marked areas that were similar, such as participants talking about a specific poster, and any notable aspects of their responses to our structured interview questions. While in hindsight we understand that semi-structured interviews probably give the best form of leeway so that the code is not already in pre-existing 'sorted' categories prior to sorting, we believe that our structured interviews (with unplanned follow up questions) provided the best of both worlds. It allowed us to get the data we were looking for and (as a bonus) additional tidbits of information. </p>

<p><i>Coding Cycle #2: Affinity Mapping (Attempt 1)</i></p>
<p>Every piece of code was written onto a sticky note and then put onto the center of the table. There was a lot less data this time around due to wanting to streamline the process, but you'll see that this was redone again in our second iteration. We came up with about 5-6 small categories, which can be best summarized as having four major elements:
<ul>
<li>Density and where their eye goes,</li>
<li>Content,</li>
<li>Their priorities (academia vs "character"), and</li>
<li>Their ability to empathize</li>
<ul><li>Better defined as â€œtheir interpretation of putting themselves in the shoes of someone putting up the poster</li></ul>
</ul>

We thought we could do better and didn't feel like there was enough substantial categorization and data, but we thought the method was pretty solid, so we ended up doing a second iteration of the exact same thing. </p>

<p><i>Coding Cycle #3: In-Vivo Coding (again)</i></p>
<p>We cleared the board and started from scratch, painstakingly taking the time to go through each interview transcript again, and also looking at the recordings to better understand the emphasis of anything that was said. Sometimes you realize the way that a participant said something might be more important than what the words themselves are, because it gives away a lot of information that can't be really put into words. The intonation and inflection of certain words, the hand gestures, the glances / pointing at the posters - those small significant details allowed us to pick and choose code that we believed were actually of value. </p>

<p><i>Coding Cycle #4: Affinity Mapping (Attempt 2)</i></p>
<p>This was the one!! This goliath of a map (the image is also in the shared Google Drive folder) is something that we believe describes our best efforts in synthesizing this enormous swath of data. We noticed that there were some similarities between the first and second attempts, but this was more detailed. </p>

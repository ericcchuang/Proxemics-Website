 <p><h3>Abstract</h3></p>

<p>The goal of this study is to discover how people put up posters in a situation with limited available space. To accomplish this, we gave participants posters of various content to put on a board in two different scenarios to see how they use up the space available to them. Observing their behavior let us explore what different spaces, poster content, and other properties people prioritized when forced to work with a finite area.
At a school like NJIT where thousands of students are crammed into a space of only a few city blocks, understanding how the student body takes up space with advertising will only be vital as the years go on. Without any development towards new infrastructure, maximizing current available space and understanding how current students perceive taking up space will help any event or program enhance their current engagement with the university student body.</p>

<p><h3>Participants and Participant Recruitment</h3></p>
<p>We recruited participants by asking our friends to ensure that we had a variety of viewpoints represented. We had four participants in this study, all sophomores of varying involvement on campus. As established in their opening interviews, they ranged from very active, to active in specific clubs they are dedicated to, to not active at all. This was to see if those who were familiar with the content on the posters would bias themselves in any way.</p>

<p><h3>Data Collection</h3></p>
<p>We start the participant with a short starting interview, asking about their activity on campus and how often they use bulletin boards or other communal spaces on campus. After this, the board is presented.</p>

<p>The board had four posters already placed on it, two towards the corners and two near the center. Intentionally, the board is too small to fit all the posters, comfortably fitting only about 15. The remaining posters were divided into two stacks based on the order they would be handed to the participant: a larger stack of 14 for the first scenario, and a smaller stack of 5 for the second scenario, all of various contents. These numbers were chosen intentionally, so that the board was barely overfilled at the end of the first scenario.</p>

<p>After the opening interview, the participant is handed the stack of 14 posters and told to arrange the posters any way they see fit on the board. They can move any poster of those 14 around, but cannot move any pre-placed posters. Participants were told that they can ask questions and to vocalize their thought process, and that they had around 10 minutes to complete the task. No further instruction was given other than 5 minute and 1 minute warnings, unless the participant asked a question.</p>

<p>After placing the first 14 posters, the participant is presented with 5 more posters, and told to place them as well. However, there is the caveat that posters from the previous scenario are now treated as immovable. The same instructions were given, with a 5 minute time limit.</p>

<p>Finally, we interviewed the participant with the closing interview. They were asked questions on what posters they covered up, what their thought process was, what content they valued on a poster, and how they prioritized the use of space. We also asked them more specific questions on the behaviors observed as they placed the posters. </p>
